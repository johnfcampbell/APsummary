# Created for collecting AP Exchange stories, but the general idea is to convert 
# an HTML table into a Python hash.
# The AP exchange stories include body text, followed by a summary in table format.
# This includes metadata such as byline, dateline, headline, category.
# First deployed at the Courier-Post, Cherry Hill, NJ
